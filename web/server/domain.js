/*
 * Printoka operations domain — the job state machine, hard gates, RBAC and priority rules from the
 * PRINTOKA PRODUCTION OPERATION MANUAL (Guidebook to Printoka Production, v1.0). Pure logic, no I/O.
 *
 * Organisation (§1.2): Production Director → Prepress / Scheduler / Logistics managers → their staff.
 *   Director: final authority, inter-department conflicts, overall KPI (§1.4)
 *   Managers: oversee daily operations, approve escalations, own the department KPI, report daily (§1.4)
 *   Staff:    execute tasks only, no override authority, escalate immediately (§1.4)
 *
 * Workflow (§1.8) — no skipping steps, no parallel shortcuts:
 *   1 Order enters system (payment confirmed)
 *   2 Prepress checks & approves the file   PASS → scheduler · MINOR → fix + approval · MAJOR → reject
 *                                           to outlet · CRITICAL → escalate to the prepress manager (§2.5)
 *   3 Scheduler queues the job              in-house: machine + time slot · outsourced: best quote (§3.5)
 *   4 Printing execution                    in-house printing done → logistics; the printer ships to production
 *   5 Logistics receives, packs & ships     the scheduler's job is done once logistics receives it; a shipment
 *                                           is complete when the customer / outlet receives it or the
 *                                           scheduler confirms delivery
 * Printers deliver to production (logistics receives) or straight to the outlet (§3.5).
